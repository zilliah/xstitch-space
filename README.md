## About
X stitch space is a free community space for cross stitchers and pattern designers. 

### For stitchers
* Keep track of your projects, floss, and notions
* Search, buy and wishlist patterns
* See what you can make using the floss in your stash
* Connect with other cross stitchers
* Help build our pattern and floss database

### For designers
* A space to sell your patterns without building your own website (or paying Etsy's high fees)
* Upload your patterns to sell directly on-site or link patterns from your website/Etsy/etc to add to our database
* See finished projects of your designs
* Connect with other designers
